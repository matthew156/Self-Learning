How CSS is Structured

-CSS has rules to control which selector is stronger in the event of a conflict
-The cascade rule states that the lower select from two selectors will be selected
-The specificity rule states that a class will prevail  over a general selector due to 
specificity. ID's have the highest specificity
-You can use the calc() function to do simiple math within CSS
-Transform can have a value of rotate(0.8turn)

@rules
-provides instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave
-A common @rule is @media, which is used to create media queries


Shorthands
-Properties like font, background, padding, border, and margin are called shorthand properties
	Example:
	padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px
		
		is the same as...
	
	padding-top:10px
	padding-right: 15px
	padding-bottom: 15px
	padding-left: 5px



Comments

understand the code
