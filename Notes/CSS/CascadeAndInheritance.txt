Cascade and Inheritance

Conflicting rules
-CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
-The concept of inheritance means that some CSS properties by default inherit values set on
the current elements parent element, and some don't


The Cascade
-Cascade means that the order of rules of CSS matter
-CSS will choose the last selector if the specificity is the same

Specificity
-Specificity is how the browser decides which rule applies when there are multiple that have
different selectors but could still applyto the same element 
-A class is more specific than an element selector so it gets priority

Inheritance
-Element can inherit from the parents but not the grandparents
	Tools to control inheritance:
	-Inherit
	-initial
	-unset
	-revert


!important
-you can use !important to over write specificity rules
