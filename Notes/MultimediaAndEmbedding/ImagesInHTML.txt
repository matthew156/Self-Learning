Images in HTML

How do we put an image on a webpage?
-The <img> tag is an empty element meaning it does not have a closing tag
-Without attributes the <img> tag would be useless.
-To embed an image use the src attribute
-NEVER pull from an existing website unless you own the image or the image is public domain, as it is illegal (known as hotlinking)


Alternative text
-The alt attribute is used on image to display text if for whatever reason the image is not
appearing
-Great for accessibility with visually impaired people or people using text only browsers
-Great for SEO
-In case if users have turned off images to reduce data transfer
-Things to consider for the alt attribute: Decoration, Content, Link, and Text


Width and height
-The width and height on images are manageable due to the width and height attribute
-Sometimes the browser will leave space for the image if it has not fully loaded yet
-When adjusting the height and width, keeping everything in respect to its correct aspect
ratio is essential

Image titles
-Adding the title attribute to images makes the image display supporting information when
the image is hovered over
-It is not reccomended due to the accesibility issues linked with the title attribute


Annotating images with figures and figure captions
-<p> tags across images are okay to use as captions, but semantically speaking, there is
nothing linking the description to the picture
-<figcaption> element allows the description to be linked to the picture, which is much better
in terms of accessibility
-Use the <figure> tag and have the <img> and <figcaption> tag nested within it.
