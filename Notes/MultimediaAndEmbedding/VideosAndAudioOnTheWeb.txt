Video and audio on the web
-HTML did not have any video or audio implementation until HTML 5
-Flash and Silverlight filled these roles before HTML 5
-<video> and <audio> elements were used to embed audio and video files, these were built using
the new JavaScript API

The <video> element

Important features of <video> element:
	-src: works the same way for <img> tag
	
	-controls: required to get the video embedded on the webpage
	
	-paragraphs: any <p> inside the the <video> element will be
	considered fallback content, if the content does not support
	the browser (typically found in older browsers...)


Using multiple source formats to improve compatibility
-Formats like MP3, MP4, and WebM are called container formats
-Container formats define a structure in which the audio and video are stored
-A WebM file contains a main video track, an alternate angle track, audio for both
English and Spanish, additon to audio and english commentary track
-Audio tracks are encoded using an audio codec, while video tracks are coded using a video codec
-Using the <source> tag allows us to use multiple sources for the videos to aid with compatibility
across devices
-Each source also has a type attribute, its optional but it is highly recommended, basically it can
allow computers to skip the type if it is not supported



Other <video> features
-Width and height
-Autoplay: makes the audio and video start playing right away
-Loop: makes the video play again when the video finishes
-Muted: Causes media to play with sound off
-Poster: The URL of an image which will be displayed before the video is played, intended for
splash screens or advertising screens
-Preload: used for buffering large files, takes the three values: none, auto, metadata



The <audio> element
-The <audio> element works very similar to <video> element
-The <audio> element does not support the width and height attributes
-The <audio> does not display the poster attribute


Displaying video text tracks
-Need to use the WebVTT file format and use the <track> element
-Subtitles: Translations of foreign material
-Captions: Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds
-timed descriptions: Text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe 
important visuals to blind or otherwise visually impaired users.
	-Example of how a VTT file should look:
WEBVTT

1
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
This is the first subtitle.

2
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
This is the second.

  ...

-To use a VTT file, use the <track> element, the kind attribute is used to specify whether
cues are subtitles, captions, or descriptions
