Basic sections of a document

header:
-usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, log and perhaps a 
tagline

navigation bar:
-should link to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs
-its better to separate content into this section for accessibility

main content:
-Unique content for each page
-Varies page to page 

sidebar:
-Contains peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc.
-May contain author's bio, or links related to the article

footer:
-A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices,
or contact info.
-Sometimes serves SEO purposes

HTML for structuring content
-Every developer should respect the semantics used with each HTML element
-This is so that visually impaired can have a similar experience on the page
-One can mark up sections of content based on functionality to make things more accessible
	Examples:
		-header: <header>
		-navigation bar: <nav>
		-main content: <main> 
			-<article>
			-<section>
			-<div>
		-sidebar: <aside>
		-footer: <footer>



HtML layout elements in more details

-<main> is for content unique to the page. Use <main> once per page and make sure it is 
nested with other elements
-<article> encloses a block of related content that make sense of its own without the rest
of the page
-<section> is similar to <article>, but its for a part of a different part of the page
-best practice to have a heading nested in a <section>
-<aside> contains content that is not directly
 related to the main content but can provide
additional information (Note this is the sidebar...)
-<header> represents a group of introductory content
-when <header> is the child of a body element it is a global header for the webpage
-when <header> is the child of a article or section it defines a specific header for the section
-<nav> contains the main navigation functionality for the page

Non-semantic wrappers
-<div> and <span> tags are examples of non-semantic wrappers
-<div> is a block-level element
-<span> is a inline-level element

Line breaks and horizontal rules
-<br> will cause a line break within a <p> tag which is useful for
-<hr> will cause a line break and create a horizontal line across the page
