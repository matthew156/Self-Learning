HTML text fundamentals

The basics: headings and paragraphs
-<h> tags are headings
-<p> tags are paragraphs
-headings have a hierarchy of 1-6
	
	Implementing structure and hierarchy
	-You should only use 1 h1
	-don't use h2 as a subheading for h3 as it breaks hiearchy order
	-You should only aim to use three headings per page
	

	Why do we need structure?
	-So the browser knows how to correctly display the information
	-Most users spend a relatively short time on the web page
	-Search engines consider headings as important keywords in websites
	-Makes it accessible to visually impaired people
	-if there is structure javascript and css can connect well with the website
	

	Why do we need Semantics?
	-To give our content the most correct meaning and function
	-Using the span tag gives our content no semantics and is perfect for just style

Lists

	Unordered
	-Makes bullet points on for the list
	-tag is <ul></ul>
	-each bullet point should contain a <li></li>
	
	Ordered
	-Great for making a numbered list
	-<ol></ol> is the tag
	-<li> is still used for list structure

	Nesting lists
	-if you want sub bullet points, nesting your list is the way to go
	-you can do this with ordered or unordered lists

Emphasis and importance

	Emphasis
	-Used to stress certain words through italics
	-The tag is <em></em>
	-These are recognized by screen readers and it will say the word emphasized in a different
	tone.
	-You should not use this just for the italics, style the span element instead

	Strong importance
	-If you want emphasize important words and place it in bold text
	-The is the <strong></strong> tag
	-You should not use this just for bold text, style the span element instead

	Italic, bold, underline
	-The strong and emphasis have a clearcut associated semantics
	-The <b>, <i>, and <u> cane about when CSS was poorly supported
	-You should use these only for styling purposes as it does not contain any semantics
	for accessibility
