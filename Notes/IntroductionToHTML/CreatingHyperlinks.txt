CREATING hyperlinks

What is a hyperlink?
-Its what makes the web a web, allows us to link documents to other documents or make apps
avaliable at a web address

Anatomy of a link
-a basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an a tag using the href
attribute
	
	Adding supporting information with the title attribute
	-The title contains additional information about the link, like the information that
	the link contains or things to be aware of on the web site
	-Can be seen when the mouse hovers over the link

	Block level links
	-Almost any content can be made into a link
	-Just wrap the a tag in an img tag

A quick primer on URLS and paths
-A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines where something is located
on the web.
-URls use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file of interest is located.
-If there is a file in the same directory, you can just reference the file name within the link
-If there is a file in a subdirectory the file path would be the directory_name/file_name
-If the there is file being reference in a previous directory the file path would be ../file_name


Document fragments
-Its possible to link to a specific part of the HTML document, known as a document fragment
-To achieve this first assign an id to the heading or element, then reference the id name 
in the href. (Example: href="#name")

Absolute versus relative URLs
-Absolute location points to its absolute location, it includes protocol and domain name
-Relative location points to the objects to the location relative to its current location

Link best practices

Use clear link wording
-Make sure the content within the a tag matches the function of the link for accessibility
-Search engines use link text to index target files, essential for SEO
-Don't repeat URL as part of the link text
-Don't say link or links to, its just noise
-Avoid having duplicate link texts for different file paths

Linking to non-HTML resources -- leave clear signposts
-You should be adding clear wording to downloads to avoid any confusion


Use the download attribute when linking to a download
-The download attribute works by having download right next to the a tag, followed by
what you want to call the file being downloaded

Email links
-Its possible to open a new outgoing email message through a link
-This is done by the mailto: URL scheme. Example <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>
-Just by having mailto: is enough to open the external email
