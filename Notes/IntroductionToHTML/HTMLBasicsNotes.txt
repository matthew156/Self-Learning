What is HTML?
-Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
-Functions mainly through tags <>
-The first tag indicates where the element starts (opening tag)
-The second tag indicates where the element ends (ending tag)
-Content is what is in between the start and end
-Opening, content, and Ending tag is what makes the element
-Attribute contain extra information about the element (example: class and id)
-Attributes should contain space between it and the element name (or different attribute),
the attribute name should be followed by an equal sign, and the attribute value should have
quotation marks


Nesting elements
-This is when another element is within an element
-Make sure nested element is closed in the element



Empty elements
-Tags like the img element do not have a closing tag
-This is because the img does not wrap content around it ie there is no content in the tag


Anatomy of an HTML document
-<!DOCTYPE html> is the doctype, meant to link to a set of rules that the HTML page has to 
follow to be considered good HTML. Example automatic error checking
-<html></html> wraps all content for the page and is also known as the root element
-<head></head> serves as a container for everything you want to be on the HTML page that
is not the content you are showing to your page's viewers
-The head tag is good for holding keywords that you are looking for to make a search engine pick up from
using the meta tag, also for page description, CSS, and character set declarations
-<meta charset="utf-8"> sets the character set of the document. UTF-8 includes most characters
-<title></title> handles the title displayed on the webpage
-<body></body> is where all of the content is stored


Images
-src attribute within the img tag should display the file path in the img
-alt attribute should be descriptive as they are often used by people with visual impairments



MARKING UP TEXT
Headings
-Headings are what the name implies <h1></h1> -<h6></h6>
-You should often use <h3/> and <h4/> tags, using <h1> just to make things bigger and bold is 
considered bad pracctice as it often neglects SEO and accessibility


Lists
-There are 2 kinds of list elements <ul> and <ol>
-<li> </li> should be nested within the elements


Links
-You can create links with the <a></a> tag
-To link have the attribute href and have the link to another page
